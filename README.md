# festview

This is a python script that allows an automation of the points on the site fest-view.com.
This script was imagined by Zellix, and coded by me and my friend Lucaas#4656, we reported the flaw to the founder of Fest-view to fix it.
For this script we used the Selenium library which allows the automation of a chromium window.
